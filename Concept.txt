Game Plan:
  This game puts you into a box pitted against a tank ai and a moarter. 
  Mechanics:
    There is an aiming system that tells the user if their current weapon trajectory will hit an enemy.
    The tank functions as to allow you to aim without reorienting the entire tank. This is done by reassigning the moveleft and moveright tools to the a and d keys rather than having the mouse orientation act as the turning.
  How to win:
    Winning is triggered when you have shot and killed the enemies on the field. 
  How to lose:
    Losing is caused by Being shot three times, signaled by when the player tank explodes.
    
Art:
  The art in this game will be made by pre-existing content via either class resources, the unreal store, or sketchfab.
  The game will take place in a 3D environment. The cover page must be a royalty-free piece.
  
Sound:
   These will play when the user fires, the bullet hits, the game is won or lost, and barrell movement. The sound for this game must be royalty-free. There should be music in both the title screen and the play area (not the same one though)
